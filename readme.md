Fake League Generator Project
    The purpose of this project is to randomly generate a fully fleshed out fake sports league including:
        1) 30 teams with City and Mascots randomly generated
        2) 25 player rosters with randomly generated first and last names
        3) AI generated Mascot art (optional)
        4) Randomly generated statistics for hitters and pitchers
        5) Store all of this in a database

    Once a league is generated it can be used to generate
        1) the results of a season or,
        2) the box score of an individual game
    based on the statistics provided in the league.
